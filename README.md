# UW Official Twin Verification Portal 🎓👯

A hilariously over-engineered "official" document proving that two students with a 17cm height difference are "mathematically identical twins" using questionable science and the power of the **Deltoid Volume Normalization Factor™**.

Created for University of Waterloo Prank Week 2026.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This is a satirical, single-file HTML document that generates an "official" twin verification certificate complete with:

- **Interactive Genetic Scanner** - Watch the "Quantum Sensors" calculate your genetic parity
- **Normalized Height Analysis** - Mathematical proof that 193cm and 176cm are actually identical
- **Official Certificate** - Complete with fake signatures, seals, and legal-sounding jargon
- **Progressive Reveal** - Sections appear dynamically as the "scan" progresses
- **Mobile Responsive** - Perfect for showing skeptics on the fly

## 🚀 Features

### 🔬 Interactive Verification System
- Click "RUN PARITY SCAN" to start the authentication process
- Real-time loading bar with technical jargon:
  - "Calculating Parallax Error"
  - "Normalizing Deltoid Volume"
  - "Analyzing Muscle Density Displacement"
- Results in a 100% MATCH every time (because science!)

### 📊 Height Normalization
Progressive display of biometric data showing how two different heights become "identical" when adjusted for:
- Muscle Density Displacement
- Gravitational Load Distribution
- Spinal Compression Factors
- The completely made-up **Deltoid Volume Normalization Factor (DVNF)**

### 📜 Official Certificate
Authentic-looking certificate issued on **March 11, 2007** (Daylight Saving Time day for maximum confusion) featuring:
- University of Waterloo official logo
- Golden verification seal
- Signatures from prestigious academics:
  - Dr. Gene Etic-Clone (PhD in Comparative Morphology)
  - Prof. Cy Amese-Twins (MSc in Applied Twinology)

### ⚠️ Legal Disclaimer
Don't worry, we included a disclaimer so we don't get expelled! It clearly states this is a parody and the Department of Genetic Redundancy & Biological Parity doesn't actually exist.

## 🎨 Customization

Want to gaslight your own friends? Easy modifications:

### Change Heights
Find these lines in `index.html`:
```html
<p class="text-3xl font-bold text-yellow-600">193 cm</p>  <!-- Subject A -->
<p class="text-3xl font-bold text-yellow-600">176 cm</p>  <!-- Subject B -->
<p class="text-4xl">184.5 cm</p>                          <!-- Normalized result -->
```

### Change Issue Date
```html
<p>Issued: March 11, 2007 | Valid Until: Heat Death of Universe</p>
```

### Change Doctor Names
```html
<p class="certificate-font text-2xl italic">Dr. Gene Etic-Clone</p>
<p class="certificate-font text-2xl italic">Prof. Cy Amese-Twins</p>
```

## 🎭 Prank Tips

1. **Show it casually** - Pull it up on your phone like it's no big deal
2. **Maintain confidence** - The key to gaslighting is conviction
3. **Reference the formula** - Point to the Deltoid Volume Normalization Factor™
4. **Use technical jargon** - "Muscle Density Displacement is well-documented"
5. **Show the disclaimer last** - Let them believe for as long as possible
6. **Share the link** - `twinpp.vercel.app` looks way more official than a local file

## ⚖️ Legal

This is a **PARODY** created for entertainment purposes only. 

- Not affiliated with the University of Waterloo
- The "Department of Genetic Redundancy & Biological Parity" does not exist
- No actual genetic testing was performed
- The Deltoid Volume Normalization Factor™ is completely fictional
- Dr. Gene Etic-Clone and Prof. Cy Amese-Twins are made-up names
- Please don't sue us, we're just students with too much time

## 🤝 Contributing

Got ideas to make this even more ridiculous? PRs welcome!

Some ideas:
- Add more fake biometric data
- Create additional "verification" steps
- Add sound effects to the scanner
- Generate downloadable PDF certificate
- Multiple language support (for international gaslighting)
- Add a QR code generator for "official verification"

## 👥 Authors

Made with ❤️ (and questionable math) by two UW students who should have been studying instead.

**Subject A** - The Tall One (193cm)  
**Subject B** - The Compact One (176cm)

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

- University of Waterloo for being good sports about Prank Week
- The International Bureau of Twin Sciences (totally real organization)
- Everyone who believed us for even a second
- Claude AI for helping us build this masterpiece of absurdity
- Vercel for free hosting of our ridiculous pranks
